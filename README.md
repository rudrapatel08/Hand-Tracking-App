# Hand Tracking App

Welcome to the Hand Tracking App repository! This project was created for my A-Level Computer Science NEA project. The repository contains the code for the project and the documentaion for the NEA is [here]()
This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful solution for hand tracking as a way of making the use of a mouse obselete. 


### Introduction

The programme is made with OpenCV and the Haar Cascade Clasifier. It works with the premise of collecting the users skin colour data and using that to identifiy there hand, of which the movemnt would be relayed to the cursor.
